# Movie React App

Before you can run this App, you need to clone repo with `git clone`.
Then add an `api.js` file into `src/utils` folder with your API data. Details see in `apiExample.js`.

After seting your credential you need to install dependencies. In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install`

## Next run a dev server:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
